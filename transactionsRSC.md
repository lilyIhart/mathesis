# Basic usage

## Image


The word “Indian” appears 1717 times in the pages of the Transaction of the Royal Society of Canada, stretching from 1881 to 1922. The term “Moundbuilders” appears 70 times.  Simply “mounds” appeared 117 times. Without Indigenous knowledge, the anthropological sections would have been decisively smaller.[^1]
